            <p className="policy_desp ">
              A basic privacy policy outlines your website’s relationship with
              users’ personal information. To succeed online and avoid legal
              turmoil, your website needs a privacy policy agreement. The first
              step to creating a compliant and comprehensive privacy policy is
              understanding exactly what that is.

              email address, or credit card information), most legislations
              around the world require that you have a privacy policy. If you
              run a website, mobile app, or desktop app, you are likely legally
              required to have a privacy policy somewhere on your site. You must
              display links to your policy clearly, prominently, and
              conspicuously, so that users can navigate to it quickly and
              easily. As data collection and processing becomes more ubiquitous
              across the internet, privacy laws in the US and around the world
              set strict requirements for privacy policies. Here are the major
              laws that affect your website privacy policy:
